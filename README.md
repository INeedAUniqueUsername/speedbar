# speedbar
My high score on 10FastFingers is 92 WPM, but I think I would do a lot better if I only had to press spacebar.

This is a TamperMonkey script that reads the word list on 10FastFingers Typing Test and automatically enters the next word when you press spacebar.

I claim no responsibility for how you use this script
